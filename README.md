This project constitutes my entry into Devember 2018. See <http://devember.org>
for more information. This year instead of writing a development log I'm going
to live stream my development process on YouTube instead; you can watch live as
recording is happening or catch the replay in
[this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI8r83BmGHOjXxsQqL9cNDJCgWWx_8XEb>).

*Note:* Each video will end with a synopsis update for the day, so you can keep
apprised of what happened without having to watch the whole video.

The repository will contain tags which represent the state of everything at the
each of day day of Devember (including an initial tag), allowing for easy
tracking of all changes made from day to day.

For this Devember I will be attempting to create a client-server based remote
build system for Sublime Text that will allow you to ship your current project
to a remote host to build/execute it.

The plan is to write the server component in [dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet)
for portability and just to gain a little more insight into working with that
technology.
