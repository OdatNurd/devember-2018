This project constitutes my entry into Devember 2018. See <http://devember.org>
for more information. This year instead of writing a development log I'm going
to live stream some of my development process on YouTube instead; you can watch
live as recording is happening or catch the replay in
[this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI8r83BmGHOjXxsQqL9cNDJCgWWx_8XEb>).

*Note:* Not all of the development each day will occur in the live stream;
Devember requires a minimum of an hour a day but I tend to do more than that.
There will also be a separate synopsis video posted late in the day or early
the next (depending on the time) to the above playlist as well, to take the
place of the devlog.

The repository will contain tags which represent the state of everything at the
each of day of Devember (including an initial tag), allowing for easy
tracking of all changes made from day to day.

For this Devember I will be attempting to create a client-server based remote
build system for Sublime Text that will allow you to ship your current project
to a remote host to build/execute it.

The plan is to write the server component in [dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet)
for portability and just to gain a little more insight into working with that
technology.
